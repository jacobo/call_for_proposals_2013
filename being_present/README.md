# Being Present

## Abstract

Do you ever get distracted by a persistent bug in production while hurtling towards the ground at 122 mph?

Find it easy to think about CSS while sweating through an intense vinyasa flow yoga class?

No?

Me neither.

And that's a really good thing.

Physical activities that demand our full attention allow us to enter a heightened mental state I call "Being Present". For me, the activity is surfing.

Take a seat in the sand, slather on the sunscreen, and I will tell tales of the mystical art of wave riding. My best days of work alway begins with a trip to the beach.

## Reviewer Notes

This is basically the same talk I gave at Cascadia Ruby conference, customized to the surf breaks near you. This talk is not about Ruby, just a case study in the lifestyle of one sometimes-effective programmer: me.

## Jacob Burkhart

Jacob is the world's foremost expert on happiness (within the subset of people who: work in Ruby for a living, surf the Pacific regularly, and brew sour beers). He does all these things in San Francisco California, while working at Engine Yard.
