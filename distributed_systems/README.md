# Living with Distributed Systems

## Abstract

We all know the problem of the monolithic rails app, and we've all accepted the divine words of Service-Oriented Architecture.  But what does your world look like once you get there? Or say, maybe, three-quarters of the way there.

Allow me to show you some of the mistakes we've made at Engine Yard on this path. It can be a bumpy road, but I promise you the destination is worth it.

## Reviewer Notes

I gave a similar talk at Rails Israel. Much of the content will be the same but I have some different ideas about how to present it. This talk is about building a comfortable multi-app dev environment (meaning, one where you can confidently write tests), so you can successfully ship distributed systems.

## Jacob Burkhart

Jacob is the world's foremost expert on Distributed Systems (within the subset of people who: work in Ruby for a living, surf the Pacific regularly, and brew sour beers). He does all these things in San Francisco California, while working at Engine Yard.
