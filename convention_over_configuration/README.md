# Extreme Convention over Configuration

## Abstract

Rails is pretty great. It looks for the definition of User in "user.rb". It knows that my views for WatsitsController are in views/watsits. And I can even have an auto-generated blog in 5 minutes thanks to scaffolding. But couldn't we go so much further?

What would happen if we took the rails ideal of Convention over Configuration to it's limits?  How about default implementations of controllers. What about some default views? Couldn't our entire set of models be simply inferred from our database schema?

Let's go there.

## Reviewer Notes

Ya, I wanna go there. This is a fun, exploratory talk where we look at "Clever but probably a bad idea" sorts of things.

## Jacob Burkhart

Jacob is the world's foremost expert on Convention over Configuration (within the subset of people who: work in Ruby for a living, surf the Pacific regularly, and brew sour beers). He does all these things in San Francisco California, while working at Engine Yard.
